Answer

The Rig Vedic period (1500-1000 BCE) marked the early phase of Vedic civilization, primarily pastoral and focused on cattle rearing. During the Later Vedic period (1000-600 BCE), society transitioned towards an agrarian economy, with greater reliance on settled agriculture and complex social structures. This shift significantly impacted social, economic, and political life, as the Ganges Valley became the cultural and economic hub of Vedic society.

Changes in Society from Rig Vedic to Later Vedic Period:

Varna System Evolution: The Rig Vedic society had a flexible social structure, but the Later Vedic period saw the formalization of the Varna system, with Brahmins and Kshatriyas dominating society.
For example: The Purusha Sukta in the later Vedas describes the creation of the four varnas.
Patriarchal Society: The status of women declined during the Later Vedic period, as patriarchal norms became more entrenched, with limited rights for women in education and property.
For example: The Rig Vedic women enjoyed freedom in choosing spouses, but by the later period, practices like child marriage
Role of Brahmins: The Brahmins gained significant power during the Later Vedic period, controlling religious rituals and advising rulers on governance, making them a powerful social class.
For example: The Yajurveda highlights the role of Brahmins in conducting elaborate rituals for kings.
Village Settlements: The Later Vedic period saw the rise of village-based society, where settled agriculture became the norm, leading to more complex community structures.
For example: The Ganga-Yamuna Doab became the central region for new agricultural communities.
Political Changes: In the Rig Vedic period, governance was managed by tribal assemblies like Sabhas and Samitis, ensuring a participatory form of decision-making. By the Later Vedic period, these assemblies were gradually replaced by monarchical kingdoms or Mahajanapadas, centralizing power in the hands of kings.
Family Structure: The joint family system became common, with the male head of the family holding authority over land and resources, reflecting the shift towards agrarian life.
For example: The Dharmashastras from the later period emphasize the joint family as the basic unit of society.
Religious Shift: Worship shifted from nature gods such as Varuna, Indra and Agni in the Rig Vedic period to more elaborate rituals and deities like Prajapati in the later period, indicating changes in religious practices.
For example: The Agni worship of Rig Vedic times gave way to complex Yajnas in the Later Vedic period.
Caste Stratification: The social stratification intensified, with the lower varnas increasingly marginalized and restricted to menial tasks.
Changes in Economy from Rig Vedic to Later Vedic Period:

Pastoral to Agrarian Economy: The Rig Vedic economy was largely pastoral, but in the Later Vedic period, agriculture became the primary economic activity, with surplus production leading to trade.
For example: Iron plows and tools were used in the Ganges Valley in the later vedic era, boosting agricultural productivity.
Land Ownership: The concept of private land ownership became prominent during the Later Vedic period, with kings granting lands to Brahmins, marking a shift from collective pastoral land use.
For example: The term Bhoomi-daan (land donation) in later texts reflects the importance of land grants.
Trade and Commerce: As society became more agrarian, trade and commerce expanded, with emerging markets and the use of barter systems for exchange.
For example: The Shrenis (guilds) mentioned in later texts organized traders and artisans into professional groups.
Cattle Wealth to Land Wealth: While cattle remained important in the Rig Vedic period, the Later Vedic period shifted focus towards land wealth, as agriculture grew in importance.
For example: The Rig Vedic Gavishti (quest for cattle) was replaced by the Ashvamedha Yajna, which symbolized territorial dominance.
Expansion of Settlements: With the rise of agriculture, settlements expanded from the Sapta Sindhu region to the Ganga plains, leading to new political and economic centers.
For example: The Mahajanapadas emerged as significant economic regions in the Later Vedic period.
Barter to Proto-Currency: The Later Vedic economy saw the shift from a barter system to the use of proto-currencies, reflecting growing complexities in trade.
For example: Early forms of coin-like objects such as Nishka and Krishnala were used for trade.
Taxation and Revenue Systems: The Later Vedic kings introduced taxation systems, collecting revenues from agriculture, which laid the foundation for future economic policies.
The shift from the Rig Vedic to the later Vedic period saw society evolve from an egalitarian structure to a more stratified hierarchy, marked by the emergence of the varna system. Economically, the transition from pastoralism to agriculture and trade laid the groundwork for future societal and economic systems.
