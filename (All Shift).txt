Sleeping, dreaming and waking are three important (1)	for ordinary humans. But for those who have (2)		transcendental knowledge, all three are almost same and there is not much difference among these three. 'The world and life is a myth and it keeps on changing' (3)	Adi Shankaracharya, the greatest 'Advaita' preacher. Ramana Maharshi observed no difference between dreaming and waking states. What he said is that it is from one unreal world to another (4)		world. There is no difference between the images one sees when waking up and the images he/she sees during dreams. According to this great sage of the modern century, the first one is daydream and the second one is a night dream. The usual philosophers say that mind and body are the two elements and mind is the source of all diverse thoughts. In the waking up state, the mind is active with all tensions and dissatisfactions, so happiness is missing: during sleep as the mind is absent and so is the physical world, the real happiness (5)	. It is said that deep sleep, where there is no feeling of body, mind and the world, is the natural state of human beings.

In the following passage, some words have been deleted. Read the passage carefully and select the most appropriate option to fill in each blank.
When Ojeya Cruz Banks moved to Ohio from New Zealand (1) 	years ago, she was overwhelmed by the logistics of uprooting her life. But Cruz Banks, a Denison University professor and a single mom, who is also my neighbour and friend, was (2) 	to find a house next to a public elementary school. She assumed that she would be able to walk to pick up her daughter, a needed convenience given that she didn't yet have a car.
Unfortunately, when she went to register her daughter for kindergarten, she was met with an
(3) 	surprise: The only (4) 	option was a half-day program that would bus students to a day-care centre on the outskirts of the town for the afternoon. The district did offer a limited number of full-day slots, but those had all been claimed in a lottery earlier that spring and came with a tuition cost. "I was like, 'Cost me? What? Public school costs money here?'" she told me.
Many parents across the United States, like Cruz Banks, may assume that free, full-day kindergarten is a (5) 	part of the country's public education system.
