<ul>
	<li>In 1922, Kisan Sabha was organized by <strong>Mohammad Zubair and Sri Krishna Singh</strong> in Munger.
	<ul>
		<li>Munger is a district in Bihar.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>It was organized to discuss the <strong>grievances of peasants </strong>as they were under the zamindari rule and did not have complete authority over their land.</li>
	<li><strong>Kisan Sabhas were more confined to Uttar Pradesh from 1919 to 1922.</strong></li>
	<li>Many peasants groups had gone violent and indulged in looting and losing the integrity of the peasant movement.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><strong>The Kisan Sabha movement was begun in Bihar. In 1929, Sahajanand Saraswati formed Bihar Provincial Kisan Sabha (BPKS).</strong></li>
	<li>All India Kisan Sabha is a peasant front working for the rights of the farmers and the anti-feudal movement in India.
	<ul>
		<li>It was established in 1936 at Indian National Congress (INC) Lucknow Session as All India Kisan Congress.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Sahajanand Saraswati who was the pioneer of Bihar Kisan Sabha Movement and patron of Bihar Provincial Kisan Sabha (BPKS) was the first President of the All India Kisan Sabha. The secretary of this union was NG Ranga.</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Aim of BPKS</strong>:
	<ul>
		<li>To abolish the Zamindari system.</li>
		<li>To reduce land revenue.</li>
		<li>To institutionalise credit.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Most of the congressmen were Zamindar themselves, so even after the success of the 1937 elections, Congress was not as vocal against the Zamindari System. Thus, the All India Kisan Sabha felt betrayed by the INC.</li>
	<li>Thus, when in 1942 Gandhiji call for Quit India Movement the peasant leaders such as Swami Sahajanand Saraswati appealed to the peasants not to support Gandhi or the INC.</li>
	<li>In May 1942, CPI took over AIl India Kisan Sabha all across the country.</li>
	<li>After the division of Communist Party of India in 1964, the front was also divided into two -&nbsp;All India Kisan Sabha (CPI) and All India Kisan Sabha (CPI-M; Akhil Bhartiya Kisan Sabha).</li>
