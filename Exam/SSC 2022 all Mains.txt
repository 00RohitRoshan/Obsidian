Read the following passage and answer the questions given after it.
Amidst a maze of rocks tucked in the Aravalli mountain ranges of Haryana, a team of
archaeologists discovered cave paintings they believe belong to the Upper Palaeolithic age.
The cave paintings have been discovered just outside the national capital and a stone‚Äôs throw
away from a holy grove called Mangar Bani- the region‚Äôs only surviving patch of primary
forest.
While the residents of the villages have been familiar with the paintings for ages, the Haryana
government‚Äôs museum and archaeology department took note of them just recently.
A fact-finding team was sent to the area in the last week of June. The team came across cave
paintings comprising images of human figurines, animals, foliage, and geometric drawings.
While some have paled over time, others are still very visible. They also discovered rock art
and open-air ceremonial sites.
Banani Bhattacharyya, deputy director of the department of archaeology and museums
informed, ‚ÄúSo far, cave paintings in Delhi-NCR have only been found here. The paintings are
yet to be dated but at least some of them belong to the Upper Palaeolithic period in all
likelihood. We are viewing the paintings in continuation with the Soanian culture which has
been found in Shivalik hills, Narmada and Aravallis.‚Äù
Most of the cave paintings found were in ochre colour, but some were in white. As per
experts, cave paintings in white are usually from a later stage (early contemporary era), while
Stone Age paintings are more often than not in ochre. ‚ÄúStone age paintings generally use red
and ochre colours. Stones of these colour used to be available locally and inhabitants
crushed the stones for preparing the colour for paintings,‚Äù added Bhattacharyya.
The Upper Paleolithic Age began around 40,000 years ago and lasted till around 10,000
years ago. While yet to be established through archaeological dating, Bhattacharyya says the
Mangar cave art is 20,000-40,000 years old. Bhattacharyya claimed that the discovery is
extremely significant. ‚ÄúStarting from the Lower Palaeolithic to Middle Palaeolithic then Upper
Palaeolithic, we see the evolution here. We have found significant remains from Lower
Palaeolithic till Middle and Upper Palaeolithic period too,‚Äù she explained. ‚ÄúThough tools from
the Palaeolithic Age have been identified earlier in parts of the Aravallis, it is for the first time

My grandmother, like everybody‚Äôs grandmother, was an old woman. She had been old and
wrinkled for the twenty years that I had known her. People said that she once had been young
and pretty and had even had a husband, but that was hard to believe. My grandfather‚Äôs
portrait hung above the mantelpiece in the drawing room. He wore a big turban and loose
fitting clothes. His long, white beard covered the best part of his chest and he looked at least
a hundred years old. He did not look the sort of person who would have a wife or children. He
looked as if he could only have lots and lots of grandchildren. As my grandmother being
young and pretty, the thought was almost revolting. She often told us of the games she used
to play as a child. That seemed quite absurd and undignified on her part and we treated it like

As the Sun inches closer to its peak activity in its solar cycle, an explosion has been picked
up behind the north-eastern limb of the star in our solar system. Solar observatories saw bits
and pieces of the explosion, which remain obscured in view from Earth's orbit.
The explosion was spotted on 31 July at around 2309 UT and Earth-orbiting satellites
registered a long-lasting C9.3-class solar flare. "The intensity is probably an underestimate
because it was partially eclipsed by the edge of the sun. Nasa's Solar Dynamics Observatory
(SDO) saw hot debris flying away from the blast site," space weather, which tracks the solar
activity, reported.
While the explosion was powerful, experts have predicted that Earth is not in the line of fire

comes to sight. Earth is not in the line of fire. The explosion is significant because it may

Read the following passage and answer the questions given after it.
Tens of thousands of people who lost their homes in a catastrophic earthquake huddled
around campfires in the bitter cold and clamoured for food and water on Thursday, three days
after the temblor hit Turkey and Syria and killed more than 19,300 on Monday, 6th February,
2023.
Emergency crews used pick axes, shovels and jackhammers to dig through twisted metal and
concrete - and occasionally still pulled out survivors.
In the Turkish city of Antakya, dozens scrambled for aid in front of a truck distributing
children's coats and other supplies. Many of those who lost their homes found shelter in tents,
stadiums and other temporary accommodation, but others slept outdoors.
In Antakya, over 100 bodies were awaiting identification in a makeshift morgue outside a
hospital.
Authorities called off search-and-rescue operations in the cities of Kilis and Sanliurfa, where
destruction was not as severe as in other impacted regions.
The U.N. is authorised to deliver aid through only one border crossing, and road damage has
prevented that thus far. U.N. Officials pleaded for humanitarian concerns to take precedence
over wartime politics.
The scale of loss and suffering remained massive. Turkish authorities said on Thursday that
the death toll had risen to more than 16,100 in the country, with more than 64,000 injured.
In Syria, which includes government-held and rebel-held areas, more than 3,100 have been
reported dead and more than 5,000 injured.
Rescue teams urged quiet in the hope of hearing stifled pleas for help, and the Syrian
paramedic group known as the White Helmets noted that every second could mean saving a
life. But more and more often, the teams pulled out dead bodies.
It was not clear how many people were still unaccounted for in both countries.
Turkey's disaster-management agency said more than 110,000 rescue personnel were now
taking part in the effort and more than 5,500 vehicles, including tractors, cranes, bulldozers
and excavators had been shipped.
The Foreign Ministry said 95 countries have offered help. More than half of that number have
sent a total of nearly 6,500 rescuers. Another 2,400 more are still expected to arrive.
International aid for Syria was far more sparse.
Efforts there have been hampered by the civil war and the isolation of the rebel-held region
along the border that is surrounded by Russia-backed government forces.

the death toll had risen to more than 16,100 in the country, with more than 64,000 injured.
In Syria, which includes government-held and rebel-held areas, more than 3,100 have been
reported dead and more than 5,000 injured.
Rescue teams urged quiet in the hope of hearing stifled pleas for help, and the Syrian
paramedic group known as the White Helmets noted that every second could mean saving a
life. But more and more often, the teams pulled out dead bodies.
It was not clear how many people were still unaccounted for in both countries.
Turkey's disaster-management agency said more than 110,000 rescue personnel were now
taking part in the effort and more than 5,500 vehicles, including tractors, cranes, bulldozers
and excavators had been shipped.
The Foreign Ministry said 95 countries have offered help. More than half of that number have
sent a total of nearly 6,500 rescuers. Another 2,400 more are still expected to arrive.
International aid for Syria was far more sparse.
Efforts there have been hampered by the civil war and the isolation of the rebel-held region
along the border that is surrounded by Russia-backed government forces.

Comprehension:
Read the following passage and answer the questions given after it.
Tens of thousands of people who lost their homes in a catastrophic earthquake huddled
around campfires in the bitter cold and clamoured for food and water on Thursday, three days
after the temblor hit Turkey and Syria and killed more than 19,300 on Monday, 6th February,
2023.
Emergency crews used pick axes, shovels and jackhammers to dig through twisted metal and
concrete - and occasionally still pulled out survivors.
In the Turkish city of Antakya, dozens scrambled for aid in front of a truck distributing
children's coats and other supplies. Many of those who lost their homes found shelter in tents,
stadiums and other temporary accommodation, but others slept outdoors.
In Antakya, over 100 bodies were awaiting identification in a makeshift morgue outside a
hospital.
Authorities called off search-and-rescue operations in the cities of Kilis and Sanliurfa, where
destruction was not as severe as in other impacted regions.
The U.N. is authorised to deliver aid through only one border crossing, and road damage has
prevented that thus far. U.N. Officials pleaded for humanitarian concerns to take precedence
over wartime politics.
The scale of loss and suffering remained massive. Turkish authorities said on Thursday that
the death toll had risen to more than 16,100 in the country, with more than 64,000 injured.

2. Because the destruction was not as severe in Syria as in Turkey.
3. Because the UN is allowed only one border crossing and Syria is not allowing that.
4. Because the roads have been damaged there
