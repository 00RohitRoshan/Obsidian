Read the given passage and answer the questions that follow.
Subhas Chandra Bose, a prominent Indian nationalist leader, was convinced that India could
not achieve independence without the use of force, and he believed that a military campaign
was necessary to achieve this goal. In 1942, Bose formed the Indian National Army (INA) with
the help of the Japanese.
Bose travelled to Japan in 1941 to seek their support in the struggle against British rule in
India. The Japanese were interested in having Bose’s help in their own efforts to expand their
influence in Southeast Asia. Bose’s vision was to create a military force to fight against the
British in India with the help of Japanese weapons and training. The INA was formed in
Singapore in September 1942 with the slogan ‘Jai Hind’ (Victory to India). The INA consisted
of soldiers who were primarily from the Indian community in Southeast Asia. They were
trained by Japanese officers and were equipped with Japanese weapons. The INA fought
alongside Japanese forces in Burma and other parts of Southeast Asia during World War II.
Bose’s leadership of the INA and his military campaigns against the British in India made him
a popular figure among many Indians. The consequences of the formation of the INA were
significant. The INA’s campaigns against the British in India and the Indian soldiers’ role in the
Burma campaign had a psychological impact on the British forces. The British were shocked
that Indian soldiers had turned against them, undermining their confidence in maintaining
control over India. The INA also had a significant impact on the Indian independence
movement. Bose’s vision of a socialist India with equal rights for all citizens inspired many
Indians. The INA became a symbol of the struggle against British colonialism, and Bose’s
slogan of ‘Jai Hind’ became a rallying cry for the independence movement.
However, the INA’s military campaigns were not successful in achieving their goal of freeing
India from British rule. The INA suffered significant losses in battles, and their efforts were
undermined by the Japanese surrender in 1945.
SubQuestion No : 34
Q.34 What was the primary reason for the Japanese to support Subhas Chandra
Bose and the formation of the INA?
Ans
1. They believed in India’s right to self-determination.
2. They were looking for allies in their fight against the British Empire.
3. They believed in Bose’s vision of a communist India.
4. They wanted to expand their influence in Southeast Asia.

Algae are photosynthetic creatures that have pigments that aid in photosynthesis, such as
chlorophyll. They do not, however, have the actual stems, roots or leaves found in vascular
plants. While some of them have many cells, others are unicellular. They might establish
colonies as well. The majority of algae are aquatic. Some are terrestrial, and they can be
found on rocks, trees and moist soil. Certain algae species coexist well with other living
things. For instance, lichens are a symbiotic relationship between green (and often blue-
green) algae and fungi. Algae are members of a multiphyletic group. This indicates that there
is no common ancestor and that the species in this category are not necessarily closely
related. They do not have other morphoanatomical characteristics typical of vascular plants,
but they do have one thing in common: they are eukaryotes with the principal pigment being
chlorophyll, which allows them to perform photosynthesis. Phycology is the scientific name for
the study of algae. The blue-green algae is one example of a reference. But some sources do
not classify them as algae because they are prokaryotes.

The extraction of indigo dye involves harvesting the small, green leaves of the Indigofera
plant before its flowers bloom. These leaves undergo a process of soaking in water and
churning until a navy blue froth is released. The upper portion of the resulting mixture is
