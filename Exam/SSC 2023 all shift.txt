Any (1) that revolves around a planet is a satellite. Mother Earth has a natural
satellite in the moon. The earth is circled by a lot of man-made or artificial satellites. In 1957,
the Soviet Sputnik was the first to be (2) into space. There are currently a number
of artificial satellites launched into space by various nations.
These satellites make it possible for us to talk on the phone, watch television, predict the

How does a satellite get started? It is typically launched into space by means of a rocket.
After ascending into the thinner air layers above the earth, the satellite is released from the
rocket. For a successful satellite launch, a rocket's speed is carefully calculated and
controlled. Every object in space is pushed toward the earth's centre by gravity. The inertia of
motion will propel the object into space if it has its own velocity of motion. When the orbital
velocity is exactly right, these two opposing forces are balanced, causing the satellite to (3)

A satellite is said to be in geo-stationary orbit when it completes one revolution around the
earth in a 24-hour period; It doesn't change when compared to a point on the surface of the
earth. These orbits are typically used by satellites for communication and weather. The
camera on the weather satellites takes pictures and sends them back to Earth. These are
